# BBS Reference Implementation

TypeScript reference implementation for the [BBS signature scheme](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/bbs-signature). The goal is to help understand and verify the specification, it is not meant as a production-ready implementation. 

This project aims to keep up to date with the [latest specification](https://identity.foundation/bbs-signature/draft-looker-cfrg-bbs-signatures.html), but may be behind since the specification changes often; the current implementation matches the *Sept 26, 2002* version of the specification.

Given the rapid evolution of the BBS scheme, there might be inconsistencies between the specification and the code; please open issues or file PRs if you find any!
